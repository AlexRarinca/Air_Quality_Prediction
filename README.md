Air Pollution: A Growing Concern

Project Overview

This repository contains the code and data for a the primary goal predicting (via nowcasting) air pollutant levels (such as O₃, PM2.5, etc.) based on historical data. This is achieved through:

- **Data Cleaning:** Merging station data, handling missing values, and mapping station locations.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Visualizing pollutant distributions, identifying trends over time, and analyzing correlations.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building and evaluating several regression models to forecast air quality.

Data Sources: Kaggle dataset from the India Central Pollution Control Board [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india] and ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) [https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/derived-near-surface-meteorological-variables?tab=overview]
